<h1>TODO: FIX THIS WITH NEW CONTENT!!!</h1>

<p>Two Rivers Aikikai is a non profit organization affiliated with the Aikido World Headquarters at Aikikai Hombu Dojo in Japan through the United States Aikido Federation. Two Rivers Aikikai is also a member dojo of Kiyoikaze Iaido Federation. The dojo was founded as a non profit organization in 1991 by Edmund Di Marco Sensei 6th Dan, Shidoin, and Ken Brown Sensei 3rd Dan, Fukushidoin along with a group of students who had been training together in the Portland Community Schools since 1985. Di Marco Sensei originally trained at New York Aikikai for several years and is a direct student of Y. Yamada Shihan. In June 2001, at our Tenth Anniversary Seminar, Di Marco Sensei announced his retirement as Chief Instructor of Two Rivers Aikikai because he and his family were moving to Florida.  He is now Chief Instructor of Lake County Aikikai. Ken Brown Sensei began his training in Gainesville, Florida in 1975 before moving to Portland in 1985. Spiros Koyanis Sensei has been Chief Instructor at the dojo since June 2001.  </p>

<h4>Our New Mural</h4><p>
<img src="/media/images/mural.jpg">We have a new mural painted by Portland Artist Christa Grimm! Two Rivers Aikikai chose Christa to paint the new mural called <b>Rising Up</b> after a considerable search for an artist who could create a mural which embodied our goals of practicing non-violence in body, mind and spirit. The mural represents perseverance and connection to meet life's challenges with the support of our environment and community. The underlying philosophy of Aikido practiced at Two Rivers Aikikai is one of harmony with one's surroundings.  The mural imagery of a migrating salmon, water currents, and cyclical forces resonates with the notions of blending, pliancy, giving and receiving, all of which are qualities practiced at Two Rivers Aikikai. <br><br>Portland artist Christa Grimm creates murals, paintings and large scale site-specific commissions for both public and private clients. Alive with color, movement and strong, confident brush strokes her images celebrate natural beauty and human vitality. <br>Click here <a href="http://www.christagrimm.com/" target='_blank'>to visit her website -  www.christagrimm.com/</a></p>

<blockquote><img src="images/skdemo.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350"  height="277" vspace="15" hspace="5" alt="At Festival Japan Iaido and Aikido demonstration Sept. 2008.">
    <p>Our Chief Instructor is <b>Spiros Koyanis Sensei, 6th Dan, Shidoin in Aikido and 3rd Dan in Iaido</b>. He is a direct student of the late Mitsunari Kanai Shihan and practiced under Kanai Sensei's guidance for twenty years. Koyanis Sensei began his training at New England Aikikai in 1983 and has been teaching Aikido to adults and children since 1989. In 2001, he became Chief Instructor of Two Rivers Aikikai. He is a firm believer in the effectiveness of non violence and as such honors the memory of Kanai Sensei in his instruction by paying close attention to Kanai Sensei's dynamic theories of the unified body and the interaction between uke and nage based on budo. Koyanis Sensei believes that Aikido is a fluid martial art that continues to grow and change based on modifications by leading practitioners. He trains several times a year at seminars and USAF summer camps under the direction of Yamada Sensei and the late Kanai Sensei's senior students including Claude Berthiaume, 7th Dan Shihan, Robert Zimmermann, 6th Dan Shihan, David Farrell, 6th Dan Shihan, and David Halprin, 6th Dan Shihan.  Koyanis Sensei practices and teaches Iaido as taught by the late Mitsunari Kanai Sensei, Grand Master of Iaido. Two Rivers Aikikai is a member dojo of <a href="aikido.htm#sausage">Kiyoikaze Iaido Federation</a> under the direction of Berthiaume Sensei.

       <b>Lynn Marshall, 5th Dan, Shidoin</b> is also a direct student of Mitsunari Kanai Shihan.   Lynn practiced karate for a year before starting Aikido at New England Aikikai in 1985.  Lynn's extension and precision demonstrate that one does not have to be big to be effective.  Lynn's ability to break down a technique and focus on details gives students a lot to think about and work with in the beginner and basics program at Two Rivers. Lynn has been practicing at Two Rivers Aikikai since July 1998. She teaches a wide variety of techniques and often includes bokken and jo kata and suburi in her classes. With a strong emphasis on basics, Lynn demonstrates advanced techniques with clarity and precision for students in mixed level classes. She is a reliable reference for students preparoing for kyu and dan tests. In addition to Aikido, Lynn practices yoga several times a week and brings a wealth of knowledge to our dojo about proper stretching techniques to gain flexibility and strength. Lynn practiced Iaido at New England Aikikai under the direction of the late Kanai Sensei and continues to practice Iaido and Aikido under the direction of Berthiaume Sensei who promoted Lynn to 5th Dan in Aikido in early 2014<i></i>.</p>
