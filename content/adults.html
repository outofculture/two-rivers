<h1>Basics Classes</h1>
<p>
     In our Basics Classes, which are open to all students, techniques and ukemi (taking falls) are
     broken down to their foundations and practiced methodically. In these classes, advanced
     students practice with less experienced students. We all learn a lot from each other.
     Understanding body structure and mechanics is an important part of gaining proficiency in
     Aikido. Since we all have different body types, we move and react in a variety of ways.
     Because of these differences, advanced students can learn a lot from the beginning students.
     <br><br>
     Please note that Saturday's Beginner and Basics classes merge into one 90 minute class. Early
     on in the beginner session, the beginners will have a chance to bow out after approximately 30
     minutes. Once they learn their forward and back rolls, they may remain on the mat for the
     entire class.

<h5>Dynamic Aikido</h5>
<p>
    Dynamic Aikido classes give us a chance to practice at a faster and more flowing pace. We still
    concentrate on the basics, but we might practice with tanto (wooden dagger) or with multiple
    attackers. We try hard to keep track of our centers and our ki. Maintaining good posture
    throughout the technique is important for both nage (the person doing the technique) and for uke
    the person being thrown or pinned). The circularity of the technique becomes more evident as we
    learn to keep moving without hesitating from beginning of the attack to the end of the throw.
    These classes are open to students comfortable with their falls.
